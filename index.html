        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
       IT IS USED FOR:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Software Development</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li> 
        <li>System Scripting</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What can Python do?</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
       <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
         <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
         <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Why python?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
        <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Python compared to other programming languages</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
          <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
          <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
        </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python Syntax">
    <header>Python Syntax</header>
    <p>The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers).<br> The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.</p>
    <article>
      <h1>Execute Python Syntax</h1>
      <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
      <code> print("Hello, World!")<br>
Hello, World!</code>
      
      <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>
      <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.</code>


      <h1>Python Indentation</h1>
      <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
      <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
      <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
      <h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
      <code>if 5 > 2:<br>
  print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
   
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python Comments">
    <header>Python Comments</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        A Python comment is a line of text in a program that is not executed by the interpreter. Comments are used during debugging to identify issues and to explain code. Comments start with a hash character (#).
      </p>
      <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>
      <p>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
      <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
      <h1>Creating a Comment</h1>
      <p>
          Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <code>#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")</code>
     <h1>Multi Line Comments</h1>
    <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.</p>
    <p>To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:</p>
  
    <p>EXAMPLE</p>
    <code>#This is a comment<br>
#written in<br>
#more than just one line<br>
print("Hello, World!")</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python Variables">
    <header>Python Variables</header>
    <article>
     A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. <br>Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.
     
     <h1>Variables</h1>
     <li>Variables are containers for storing data values.</li>
     <h1>Creating Variables</h1>
     <li>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</li>
        <li>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</li>
      <p>Example</p>
      <code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code>
      <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
      <code>x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)</code>
      <h1>Casting</h1>
      <li>If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.</li>
      <code>x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0</code>

  <h1>Get the Type</h1>
  <li>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.</li>
  <code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))</code>
    </article>
  </section>


  <section class="main-section" id="Python Datatypes">
    <header>Python Datatypes</header>
    <h1>Built-in Data Types</h1>
    <p>Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes</p>
    <p>
      In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
    </p>
    <code>Text Type:      str
          Numeric Types:  int, float, complex
          Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
          Mapping Type:   dict
          Set Types:      set, frozenset
          Boolean Type:   bool
          Binary Types:   bytes, bytearray, memoryview</code>
    
      <h1>Getting the Data Type</h1>
    <li>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</li>
      <code>x = 5
print(type(x))</code>


  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python Numbers">
    <header>Python Numbers</header>
    <article>
      <h1>Python Numbers</h1>
      <li>int</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>complex</li>
      <p>
       Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
      <code>x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex</code>

    <p>To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:</p>
    <code>print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))</code>

    <h1>Int</h1>
    <li>Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.</li>
    <code>x = 1
        y = 35656222554887711
        z = -3255522

        print(type(x))
        print(type(y))
        print(type(z))</code>

        <h1>Float</h1>
        <li>Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.</li>
        <code>x = 1.10
               y = 1.0
                z = -35.59

                print(type(x))
                print(type(y))
                print(type(z))</code>
        <p>Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.</p>
        <code>x = 35e3
               y = 12E4
                z = -87.7e100

                print(type(x))
                print(type(y))
                print(type(z))</code>

          <h1>Complex</h1>
          <li>Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:</li>
          <code>x = 3+5j
                 y = 5j
                   z = -5j

                  print(type(x))
                  print(type(y))
                  print(type(z))</code>
          <h1>Type Conversion</h1>
          <li>You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:</li>
          <code>x = 1    # int
                            y = 2.8  # float
                                z = 1j   # complex

                                  #convert from int to float:
                                  a = float(x)

                                    #convert from float to int:
                                        b = int(y)

                                        #convert from int to complex:
                                            c = complex(x)

                                                  print(a)
                                                          print(b)
                                                              print(c)

                                                                  print(type(a))

  <section class="main-section" id="Python Casting">
    <header>Python Casting</header>
      <p>Casting is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. This is, in Python, done with functions such as int() or float() or str() . <br> A very common pattern is that you convert a number, currently as a string into a proper number.</p>
    <article>
      <h3>Specify a Variable Type</h3>
      <p>
       There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
      </p>
      <p>Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:</p>
          <li>int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)</li>
          <li>float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)</li>
          <li>str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals</li>
          <p>Integers</p>
          <code>x = int(1)   # x will be 1
            y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
            z = int("3") # z will be 3</code>
          <p>Floats</p>
          <code>x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
          y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
          z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
          w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2</code>

        <p>Strings</p>
        <code>x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
          y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
          z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'</code>


    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python Strings">
    <header>Python Strings</header>
    <article>
      <h1>Strings</h1>
      <p>
       Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
          'hello' is the same as "hello".
          You can display a string literal with the print() function:
                </p>
      <code>print("Hello")
        print('Hello')</code>

    <h3>Assign String to a Variable</h3>
    <li>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:</li>
    <code>a = "Hello"
          print(a)</code>

    <h3>Multiline Strings</h3>
    <li>You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:</li>
    <code>a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
            consectetur adipiscing elit,
            sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
            ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
            print(a)</code>
      
      <h1>Strings are Arrays</h1>
      <li>Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
            However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
            Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</li>
      <code>a = "Hello, World!"
                    print(a[1])</code>
    <h3>Looping Through a String</h3>
    <li>Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.</li>
    <code>for x in "banana":
  print(x)</code>

    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python Boleans">
    <header>Python Boleans</header>
    <li>Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.</li>
    <article>
      <h1>Boolean Values</h1>
       <li>In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
                You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
                When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:</li>
                      <code>print(10 > 9)
                print(10 == 9)
                print(10 < 9)</code>
        <p>When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:</p>
          <li>a = 200
                    b = 33

                    if b > a:
                      print("b is greater than a")
                    else:
                        print("b is not greater than a")</li>
      <h3>Evaluate Values and Variables</h3>
      <li>The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,</li>
      <code>print(bool("Hello"))
            print(bool(15))</code>
      <h3>Most Values are True</h3>
      <li>Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.<br>
          Any string is True, except empty strings.
          Any number is True, except 0.
          Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.</li>
          <code>bool("abc")
            bool(123)
            bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])</code>
      <h3>Some Values are False</h3>
      <li>In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.</li>
              <p>the following returns false</p>
              <code>bool(False)
                  bool(None)
                  bool(0)
                  bool("")
                  bool(())
                  bool([])
                  bool({})</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python Operators">
    <header>Python Operators</header>
      <li>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
            In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:</li>
    <article>
      <p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic operators - Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations</li>
            <li>Assignment operators - Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables</li>
            <li>Comparison operators - Comparison operators are used to compare two values</li>
            <li>Logical operators - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements</li>
            <li>Identity operators  - Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location</li>
            <li>Membership operators  - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object</li>
            <li>Bitwise operators - Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers</li>

    <article>
     <h1>SET</h1>
     <li>Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
              Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
              A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.
              Sets are written with curly brackets.</li>
                  <code>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                  print(thisset)</code>

                  <h3>Set Items</h3>
                  <li>Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.</li>
                  <h3>Unordered</h3>
                  <li>Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
                        Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.</li>
                  <h3>Unchangeable</h3>
                  <li>Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created</li>
                  <h3>Duplicates Not Allowed</h3>
                  <li>Sets cannot have two items with the same value.</li>
                  <code>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

        <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
            <li>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
                If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:</li>
              <code>car1 = "Ford"
                    car2 = "Volvo"
                    car3 = "BMW"</code>

                <p>However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
                    The solution is an array!
                    An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.</p>
                    <h3>Access the Elements of an Array</h3>
                    <li>You refer to an array element by referring to the index number.</li>
                    <code>x = cars[0]</code>
                    <h3>The Length of an Array</h3>
                    <li>Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).</li>
                    <code>x = len(cars)</code>

                    <h3>Looping Array Elements</h3>
                      <li>You can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.</li>
                      <code>for x in cars:
                              print(x)</code>
                              <h3>Adding Array Elements</h3>
                              <li>You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.</li>
                              <code>cars.append("Honda")</code>
                              <h3>Removing Array Elements</h3>
                              <li>You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.</li>
                              <code>cars.pop(1)</code>

    <header>Python Classes/Objects</header>
      <li>Python is an object oriented programming language.
            Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
            A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</li>

            <h3>Create a Sample Class</h3>
            <code>class MyClass:
                  x = 5</code>
                  <p>Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:</p>
                  <code>p1 = MyClass()
                    print(p1.x)</code>

                    <h3>The __init__() Function</h3>
                    <li>he examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
                        To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
                        All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
                        Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created</li>
                        <code>class Person:
                              def __init__(self, name, age):
                                self.name = name
                                self.age = age

                            p1 = Person("John", 36)

                            print(p1.name)
                            print(p1.age)</code>
                        <h3>Object Methods</h3>
                        <li>Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.</li>
                        <p>Let us create a method in the Person class:</p>
                        <code>class Person:
                                def __init__(self, name, age):
                                  self.name = name
                                  self.age = age

                                def myfunc(self):
                                  print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

                              p1 = Person("John", 36)
                              p1.myfunc()</code>
                              <h3>The self Parameter</h3>
                                <li>The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class</li>
